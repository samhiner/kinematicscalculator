		Equation Parser, let users define size of charts (make sure dragging
		only goes to the edge of this bc the plugin makes dragging beyond that
		look bad). Embed link. See ball moving according to the graph. Get raw
		array of values. Add points by clicking at a spot. Negative t. 
		Available presets for simple kinematics like having one for const
		acceleration. Make weird resolutions not look terrible. Add slope 0
		acceleration option.

		<strong>Guide to future me for when I have time to implement this:
		</strong> I figured out what is wrong with the lambdas. I am trying to 
		model the math for how they should work with traditional kinematics 
		scenarios. The problem is that the fundamental way these graphs work 
		does not support those scenarios. For example, if you have x slope for 
		position which suddenly changes the velocity graph should be a 
		constant then instantly become a different constant. Any changes take 
		at least the distance between two points to occur. So, the easiest way 
		to fix this would be having two points at each spot where there should 
		be one point so it can instantly change. Maybe three points bc in the 
		acceleration graph it would show the acceleration going up to x for an 
		instant then immediately back down. Anyways, the structure will have 
		to be re-done to support this so it will take a little while.
