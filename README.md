### Kinematics Calculator

See how graphs of position, velocity, and acceleration against time are related to each other by seeing how modifying one changes the values of the other graphs. 

### Features

* Drag points on any one of the graphs to see how it affects the other graphs.
* Change the number of seconds you see, and how many changeable points there are per second.
* Support for fractions of a second and one point for multiple seconds.

## Upcoming

* Insert your own function and see how the three graphs look according that function.
* See what a ball moving according to those graphs would look like.
* Create embedding code for the graphs.
* Templates for graphs which pertain to usual kinematics problems.
